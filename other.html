                    <figcaption>The copepod is the earthly angel - an indicator of God's omnipresence, in every water habitat that exists under the vault of Heaven. Fun Fact: The Pope's mouthwash always contains a number of copepods, to preserve the holiness of his teeth. </figcaption>

                    <figcaption>The krill is a suitable stand-in for the shrimp. While blessed as a crustacean in any case, the krill is too long for its own good. However, they are noted for the bravery of their matyrdom at the hands of whales, servants of the devil, and such they have earned their entry into Heaven.</figcaption>

                    <figcaption>While a creation of the lord, as all crustaceans are, the amphipod is too soft to enter heaven by virtue of its birth. However, it can be considered representative of the theological sinner, in that its atonement for the unholiness of its birth may earn it a place by the side of the Lord.</figcaption>

                    <figcaption>The hermit crab is representative of the devil in traditional theology, due to its usage of the shells of other beings as vessels for its own malleable body - while some may consider this role damnable, it is honourable of the hermit crab to concede its purity to perform such a vital metaphysical role.</figcaption>
